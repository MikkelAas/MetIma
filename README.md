# Cool imaging viewing application 

Uni project done by:
- Mikkel Aas
- Magnus Gluppe
- Jakob Karlsmoen
- Mikael Krog

If you really want to run this, all that _should_ be needed is Java 11 + Maven, and executing this command in the root dir:
```BASH 
mvn compile package
``` 

The ouput jar should end up in `shade/`.
